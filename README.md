# Our Chat !

**An easy-to-install Enterprise LLM chat system using LibreChat with AWS Bedrock and LDAP/AD authentication.** 

Why is this needed? Can't users just access AWS Bedrock directly? They might; however, in most organizations, the AWS Console is reserved for power users, as it typically takes some time until you are familiar with it (to put it mildly). 

[LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), on the other hand, takes zero on-boarding time; users simply login with their enterprise credentials and use the system just like ChatGPT or Claude.ai. Another reason to like LibreChat is its superior user interface. It has gained much popularity and is [often trending](https://trendshift.io/repositories/4685) on GitHub.

You can bring up a LibreChat server in 5 minutes [once you have the prerequisites](#prerequisites).

Other big benefits: 

- No per-user cost. Even a few hundred ChatGPT users can cost an organization hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. With LibreChat, you can serve tens of thousands of users and only pay the API cost of what they actually use. 
- No configuration needed to prevent the cloud LLM from learning with your data. All API use in Bedrock, as well as OpenAI, is excluded from learning usage.
- Presumably better security: OpenAI, Anthropic, and other startups have significantly smaller cybersecurity operations than the cloud Hyperscalers, such as AWS, Azure, & Google.
- Unified user interface: In addition to Bedrock, you can use OpenAI or Google API or even [on-prem use cases](#On-premisesusecases), all within the same interface.

## <a name='Prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites 

Hard prerequisites

- A virtual server with at least 1GB RAM and 25GB free disk space and a current Linux OS installed.
  - The install script will automatically pick the largest file system for install. If the largest file system is not mounted as `/` it will create /home and /var/lib/docker elsewhere, for example under /opt.
  - The machine should have Amazon Linux (tested AL2023), RHEL (tested Rocky 9.4) or Ubuntu (tested 24.04 LTS) installed. 
  - Note hat both ARM and X86 are supported. On AWS we recommend a Graviton/ARM instance (e.g. t4g.micro costs less than $6 per month)
- You must be able to reach this server on http port 80 and https port 443.
- The Server must have a DNS entry pointing to it. Take note of the hostname with domainname (FQDN)
- AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) for an AWS service account (perhaps called librechat or ochat) that has no permissions except for the AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy attached to it. 
- An SSL certificate (often a PKCS12 archive by IT), unless your http port 80 can be reached from the internet, which allows you to use Let's Encrypt.

Optional prerequisites

- As this server might process sensitive data, ask for all security software (log forwarder, Antivirus/malware, intrusion prevention) to be preinstalled.
- Consider an encrypted volume for addional security 
- If you use LDAP, this machine must be able to communicate with the `ldaps port 636` of your enterprise LDAP server (for example, Active Directory). 
- An LDAP/AD security group that contains the users, who are allowed to use the chat system. For now, we call this group `our-chat-users`.

You don't need root access to the virtual server if your IT team can run the `prepare-server.sh` script for you, but they should allow you to switch to the ochat user, e.g., `sudo su - ochat`. Alternatively, if you must run `prepare-server.sh` yourself, they can setup a [granular sudo config](#i-dont-have-root-permissions) for you. 

## <a name='PrepareServer'></a>Prepare Server 

Run the [prepare-server.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/refs/heads/main/prepare-server.sh) script as root user to install docker and prepare the `ochat` user account. You can also start it as a normal user if you have requested the correct [sudo config](#i-dont-have-root-permissions). You will be prompted for the hostname incl. domainname (FQDN) of your system. Please enter it, if you want to use Let's Encrypt.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/refs/heads/main/prepare-server.sh?token=$(date +%s) | bash
```

After the script has finished, switch to the ochat user with `sudo su - ochat` and continue with [Prepare install](#prepare-install).

## <a name='Prepareinstall'></a>Prepare install

After switching to the ochat user (`sudo su - ochat`), please clone the [our-chat](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/) repository from GitHub and copy the .env.ochat, librechat.yml and nginx-ourchat.conf files to the root of the home directory of the ochat user:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/
cp ~/our-chat/.env.ochat ~/.env
cp ~/our-chat/librechat.yaml ~/librechat.yaml
cp ~/our-chat/nginx-ourchat.conf ~/nginx-ourchat.conf
```

## <a name='AWSconnectivity'></a>AWS connectivity

Export the AWS credentials and region of the Bedrock service account (the one that has only the AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy attached) to environment variables, go to the terminal of another computer that has the right credentials configured, and paste these 4 commands into the terminal to generate the export statements below (You can change the AWS_PROFILE environment variable to something else if you are working with a different AWS profile, e.g such as `bedrock`):

```
export AWS_PROFILE="default"
echo -e "\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id)"
echo -e "export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key)"
echo -e "export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$(aws configure get region)"
```

then paste the 3 generated export statements to the computer that you are configuring now.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```

Then test the connectivity to AWS Bedrock by running:

```
~/our-chat/tests/bedrock-test.py
```

You should see that your credentials have been written to the correct places under ~/.aws by bedrock-test.py and Bedrock shows a list of available models and responds to a "Hello World" prompt:

```
Written to /home/librechat/.aws/credentials: AWS credentials for [default]
Written to /home/librechat/.aws/config: AWS region configuration for [default]

List of available models on AWS Bedrock:

amazon.titan-tg1-large
amazon.titan-embed-g1-text-02
.
.
mistral.mistral-large-2407-v1:0

Response to 'Hello, world' with model anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0:
 Hello! How can I assist you today? Feel free to ask me any questions or let me know if you need help with anything.
```

If you don't get that response or the script shows an error, go back to your AWS Administrator for troubleshooting your AWS credentials or permissions before you continue. (Note: To access some bedrock models you must specifically request authorization for each AWS account as you need to accept an EULA)

You can find more details about AWS in the AWS budget section below. 

If you do not require any further configuration, such as SSL certificates from IT or LDAP authentication you can now [start the LibreChat install](#install-librechat)

## <a name='SSLcertificates'></a>SSL certificates 

### receiving SSL certs from IT

Here we cover the standard case of you receiving SSL certs from your enterprise team. In many cases your team will send you a PKCS12 archive which comes as a *.pfx file along with an import password. After entering the import password, you need to set a new PEM pass phrase. At the end of this process you should have `~/our-chat.pem` and `~/our-chat.pw` at the root of the ochat home directory. (Please note: If you **leave a space at the beginning** of the echo "your-pem-passphrase" line, the pass phrase will not end up in your bash history). 

```
openssl pkcs12 -in cert-from-IT.pfx -out ~/our-chat.pem

Enter Import Password:
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:

 echo "your-pem-passphrase" > ~/our-chat.pw
chmod 600 ~/our-chat.*

```

### receiving SSL certs from Let's encrypt 

If your server is reachable from the internet on http standard port 80, you can use `Let's encrypt`. The install script will ask for a server hostname (FQDN). Please enter it. 

If you do not require any further configuration, such LDAP authentication you can now [start the LibreChat install](#install-librechat)

## <a name='LibreChatConfiguration'></a>LibreChat Configuration

You will likely need to edit each of these config files at some point, but for now you should only edit the `~/.env` file to enable LDAP authentication and to update a few security tokens. If you are in a [Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity](#DisasterRecoveryBusinessContinuity) sitution, please do not edit the 3 files below but restore them from your secure location.

### <a name='env'></a>.env

Please find these LDAP settings in ~/.env and enable them. If you decide to not use LDAP please review the `allowedDomains` setting in `librechat.yaml`

```
vi ~/.env 

#LDAP_URL=ldaps://ldap.domain.edu:636
#LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE=OU=User Accounts,dc=domain,dc=edu
#LDAP_BIND_DN=CN=myserviceaccount,OU=Service Accounts,OU=User Accounts,DC=domain,DC=edu
#LDAP_BIND_CREDENTIALS="ad-password"
#LDAP_LOGIN_USES_USERNAME=true
#LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER=(&(sAMAccountName={{username}})(memberOf=CN=our-chat-users,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=edu))
#LDAP_FULL_NAME=displayName
```

The LDAP settings should be pretty self-explanatory. For example, `LDAP_LOGIN_USES_USERNAME` means that you can log in with your username instead of typing your entire email address. The LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER is a bit of a workaround that we use to restrict LibreChat to members of an AD/LDAP security group. The filter was not intended for authorization, and if a new user is not a member of that group, they will get a 401 error (AuthN) instead of 403 (AuthZ). This can be a bit confusing. On some LDAP systems, the LDAP_BIND_DN can be the email address (aka service principal) of the service account, e.g., `myserviceaccount@domain.edu`, but it is safest to use the DN (distinguished name).


After you have configured all 7 settings, please use the LDAP test script `~/our-chat/tests/ldap-test.py <testuser>` to verify these settings. To check the LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER, you have to pass the username of a test user who is member of that security group (e.g. our-chat-users)

```
~/our-chat/tests/ldap-test.py peterdir
```
and should see something like this 
```
Successfully read environment variables: ['LDAP_URL', 'LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE', 'LDAP_BIND_DN', 'LDAP_BIND_CREDENTIALS', 'LDAP_LOGIN_USES_USERNAME', 'LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER', 'LDAP_FULL_NAME']

Connected as: CN=myserviceaccount,OU=Service Accounts,OU=User Accounts,DC=domain,DC=edu

Evaluating LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER with testuser peterdir:

Evaluating search filter: (&(sAMAccountName=peterdir)(memberOf=CN=our-chat-users,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=edu))
Found 1 matching entries:
DN: CN=peterdir,OU=User Accounts,DC=ohsum01,DC=ohsu,DC=edu
Attributes:
  displayName: Dirk Petersen
  memberOf: ['CN=unix_ochat,OU=Groups,DC=domain,DC=edu', ......
```

And as a final step we want to setup unique tokens for 

CREDS_KEY, CREDS_IV, JWT_SECRET, JWT_REFRESH_SECRET and MEILI_MASTER_KEY

Go to https://www.librechat.ai/toolkit/creds_generator, generate keys and replace the existing tokens for these 5 keys in ~/.env 

```
vi ~/.env
```

You can likely skip the next 2 config files for now, but might want to change them later 

### <a name='librechatyamloptional'></a>librechat.yaml (optional)

For example, use `vi ~/librechat.yaml && cp ~/librechat.yaml ~/LibreChat/` to change the terms of service, modify the site footer and change a few advanced bedrock settings, for example allowed AWS regions. If you decide not to use LDAP authentication, you can enable self registration but I would recommended to limit this to certain domains (`allowedDomains`) to force users to use their institutional email address for signup. 

```
registration:
  socialLogins: ['github', 'google', 'discord', 'openid', 'facebook']
  allowedDomains:
   - "university1.edu"
   - "university2.edu"
```

### <a name='nginxconfoptional'></a>nginx-ourchat.conf (optional)

The only change `vi ~/nginx-ourchat.conf && cp ~/nginx-ourchat.conf ~/LibreChat/client/` likely requires, is setting the filenames for the SSL certificates for https, if you choose a different cerificate name than our-chat.pem / our-chat.pw . You can set addional nginx headers to further enhance security.

```
   ssl_certificate /etc/librechat/ssl/our-chat.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/librechat/ssl/our-chat.pem;
   ssl_password_file /etc/librechat/ssl/our-chat.pw;
```

## <a name='InstallLibreChat'></a>Install LibreChat

When all the prep work is done correctly, you should be able to run `install-librechat.sh` and 

```
~/our-chat/install-librechat.sh
```

have a running system in a few minutes:

Now try to access your chat system, e.g. `https://ourchat.domain.edu`. If you encounter issues, please see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

## Manage and update LibreChat

To stop and start LibreChat, switch to the ochat user and run these commands:

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
```
and
```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml up -d
```

To upgrade to the latest version, switch to the ochat user and enter these commands:

```
cd ~/LibreChat
docker compose -f deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
git pull 
docker compose -f deploy-compose-ourchat.yml pull
docker compose -f deploy-compose-ourchat.yml up
```

if everything works, we start LibreChat in Daemon mode: 

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml up -d
```

should an upgrade fail, please follow these steps (Note: The chat history and uploaded files of all users will be lost)

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
mv ~/LibreChat ~/LibreChat.fail.1
~/our-chat/install-librechat.sh
```

## <a name='Budgeting'></a>Budgeting 

Since LibreChat does not support cost control at this time, we need to rely on AWS. The service `AWS Budgets` is a good start, but we quickly realize that this product is for alerting only and does not actually stop services from being used, if there is a budget overrun. AWS will point out that there is another service called `AWS Budget Actions`, but it seems those are mainly triggering `AWS Lambda` scripts. They also lack the flexibility we need, which raises the question: why not just run an hourly Lambda script to check our spend?

Let's assume our monthly budget is $1000 (and not a penny more). If we disable the service after $950 has been spent, this may happen on the first day of the month, and then nobody will be able to use the system for the rest of the month. We could also set the budget to $32 per day, and with a maximum of 31 days in a month, we would never exceed $992 / month. But that would mean people cannot really do big things, and we want to support innovation. We do not want someone to be constrained by the $32 per day if only $100 has been spent this month.

So let's see if we can accumulate the budget. For example, if the system has not been used for 3 days, we would set the budget of the 4th day to $128 (`$32*4`). If someone came and used that entire amount on the 4th day, we would start fresh on the 5th day, and the budget would be $32 per day again. In an extreme case, assume the system has not been used for the first 30 days in a month. Then someone could come along and use $960 (`$32*30`) on the 31st day, and we would still be within budget.

How should this be implemented? Please see https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/issues/1 for further discussion.

## <a name='APIusage'></a>API usage 

LibreChat does not support API access (there is the RAG API feature, but that is a bit of a misnomer, as it actually requires the web ui). Instead, LibreChat is an aggregation point for many different APIs for users. Currently, LibreChat does not support complex cost control and all users of one server will access the same AWS account and there is only one single line item on the invoice and we cannot who was responsible for the cost. API users can automate their workflows which can lead to runaway costs. This means that API users should get their own AWS account with their own budget control and access the Bedrock API direcly. ~/our-chat/tests/bedrock-test.py may service as a reasonable initial example that can list LLMs and ask a question.

## <a name='Purgingofoldchats'></a>Purging of old chats

Especially in healthcare environments we want to make sure that sensitive data does not reside on systems any longer than necessary. As of October 2024 LibreChat does not have the ability to purge data, however OurChat by default has a [purge script](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/blob/main/purge_old_messages.py) activated, that deletes any messages and files older than X days. (60 days by default)


## <a name='DisasterRecoveryBusinessContinuity'></a>Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity / Emergency Operation

As the system only stores data temporarily, disaster recovery and business continuity procedures are limited to backing up 5 configuraton files / certificates in a secure place: 

```
~/.env
~/librechat.yaml
~/nginx-ourchat.conf
~/our-chat.pem
~/our-chat.pw
```

The install procedures at https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat also serve as disaster recovery process as they are enabling you to restore service in less than 30 minutes, once you have the prerequisites met. (You may decide to have  another VM already running to reduce the provisioning time).

While following the install procedures do not edit any of the 5 files but restore them from your secure backup location to `~/` (the root of the home direcotry of the service account) and copy them to the right locations in your LibreChat installation:

```
cp ~/.env ~/LibreChat/
cp ~/librechat.yaml ~/LibreChat/
cp ~/nginx-ourchat.conf ~/LibreChat/client/
cp ~/our-chat.pem ~/LibreChat/client/ssl/
cp ~/our-chat.pw ~/LibreChat/client/ssl/
```

## <a name='On-premisesusecases'></a>On-premises use cases

If you have use cases that are not permitted to use cloud services (e.g. patent issues), you can use on premises GPUs or even [connect to your HPC cluster](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/forever-slurm) and use those resources all within the same LibreChat interface. Configure these custom endpoints [in .env](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/blob/main/.env.ochat#L57) and [in librechat.yaml](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/blob/main/librechat.yaml#L74)
 

## Missing Features 

There are a few features we'd like to see in LibreChat in the future

- more mature support for authorization through LDAP security groups: https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/3955
- Track which LLM actually provided an answer: https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/4012
- Better retention handling: https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/2365
  



## <a name='Longertermvision'></a>Longer term vision 

In the future we may extend our chat eco-system, and add apps with addional capabilities but at this time LibreChat seems to meet our needs. 

![our-chat-dark](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/our-chat/assets/1427719/6fbbc55d-8bf3-4c7f-8d09-990c3ee3c2e6)


## <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting 

### <a name='Getdebugoutput'></a>Get debug output

If something is not working, the first step is to enable debugging and bringing up the docker containers in non-daemon mode so that they are printing all logs to the console. Setup debug output, open ~/.env in editor 

```
vi ~/.env && cp ~/.env ~/LibreChat/
```

and set `DEBUG_LOGGING=true` 

Open up a second terminal, shutdown the containers and bring them up again, this time  (`up without a -d`)

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml up
```

Check for error messages. When you are done, execute the `down` and then the `up -d`. command 

### <a name='cannotcreatedockergroup'></a>cannot create docker group

In some cases your docker installation may not create a `docker` group in /etc/group. This is often because your IT department may have created a global docker group in their IAM system in order to manage their systems centrally. In that case the `groupadd docker` command will fail. There are 2 workaounds for this:

1. You can try editing `/etc/group` directly and add a line `docker:x:986:ochat` to it. The downside of this approach is, that you then have 2 different docker groups with different gidNumbers. While it should work without issues, it can be confusing, expecially if you are troubleshooting 
1. You can create a new group (for example `ldocker`, e.g. for local docker), add the ochat user to it and ask docker to use it instead of the `docker` group. This requires these steps:

- edit /etc/docker/daemon.json 

```
sudo echo -e '{\n  "group": "ldocker"\n}' >> /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

- run `systemctl edit docker.socket` and set the SocketGroup=ldocker

```
### Editing /etc/systemd/system/docker.socket.d/override.conf
### Anything between here and the comment below will become the new contents of the file

[Socket]
SocketGroup=ldocker

### Lines below this comment will be discarded
```

- restart the docker socket (not the docker daemon) and check that the socket has the correct group ownership

```
systemctl restart docker.socket

ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw----. 1 root ldocker 0 Oct  4 21:23 /var/run/docker.sock
```

If this is not working, please remove the docker packages using `dnf` and reinstall docker


### <a name='Idonthaverootpermissions'></a>I don't have root permissions 

If your IT infrastructure team cannot give you `root` access to the virtual server you requested, you may still be able to get access to management features via sudo. Ask your sysadmin to run `visudo` and paste in the config below. Change yourusername to your actual user name:

```

### <a name='Cleaningupdocker'></a>Cleaning up docker 

```
### cleanup as root
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd/*
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Moving docker data to different volume 

Let's assume docker should move to `/vol1/var/lib/docker/`. Execute these steps.

as user ochat run 

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml down
```

As administrative user with sudo permission to rsync run this:

```
NEWROOT="/vol1/var/lib/docker"
mkdir -p /tmp/myetc/docker
sudo systemctl stop docker
echo -e "{\n \"data-root\": \"${NEWROOT}\"\n}" > /tmp/myetc/docker/daemon.json
sudo rsync --chown root:root -a /tmp/myetc/docker/ /etc/docker/
sudo rsync -aAHSXv --mkpath --stats /var/lib/docker/ ${NEWROOT}/
mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.old
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo su - ochat
```

as bask as user ochat run

```
docker compose -f ~/LibreChat/deploy-compose-ourchat.yml up -d
```
